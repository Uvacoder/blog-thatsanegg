JavaScript can do a lot of amazing things!

From complex frameworks to handling API‚Äôs, there is just SO much to learn.

But, it also enables you to do some awesome stuff using just one single line.

Check out these 10 oneliners to step up your JavaScript game!

<hr/>

## 1. Capitalize the first letter of a string

Using this function, you‚Äôll be able to capitalize the first letter of the input of a string. This could be a single word, but also an entire sentence.

![JavaScript function that capitalizes the first letter of a sentence.](/assets/one-1.png)

```javascript
// Capitalize the first letter of a string
const capitalize = str => `${str.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}${str.slice(1)}`;

capitalize("hello, you are a cool person!");
// Result: "Hello, you are a cool person!"
```

## 2. Calculate the number of days between two dates

This can be a little tricky to figure out sometimes. The ‚Äú1000 \* 60 \* 60 * 24‚Äù is the number of milliseconds that are in a single day.

![JavaScript function that calculates the number of days between 2 dates](/assets/one-2.png)

```javascript
// Calculate the number of days between two dates
const diffDays = (date, otherDate) => Math.ceil(Math.abs(date - otherDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

diffDays(new Date('2014-12-19'), new Date('2020-01-01'));
// Result: 1839
```

## 3. Convert a string to a number

A very straight forward way of converting a string to a number using type coercion.

![JavaScript function that converts a string containing a number to an actual number](/assets/one-3.png)

```javascript
// Convert a string to a number implicitly
toNumber = str => +str;

// Convert a string to a number explicitly
toNumber = str => Number(str);

toNumber("2");
// Result: 2
```

## 4. Check if an array contains any items

Using the ‚ÄúisArray‚Äù method and checking if the length of the array is higher than 0, we can check if it is empty.

![JavaScript function that checks if an array is empty](/assets/one-4.png)

```javascript
// Check if an array contains any items
const isNotEmpty = arr => Array.isArray(arr) && arr.length > 0;

isNotEmpty([1, 2, 3]);
// Result: true

isNotEmpty([]);
// Result: false
```

## 5. Different ways of merging multiple arrays

There are a couple of different ways of merging arrays. One of them is using the ‚Äúconcat‚Äù method. Another one is using the spread operator (‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù).

We can also rid the final array of any duplicates using the ‚ÄúSet‚Äù object.

![A couple of different ways of merge multiple arrays using JavaScript](/assets/one-5.png)

```javascript
// Different ways of merging multiple arrays

// Merge but don't remove the duplications
const merge = (a, b) => a.concat(b);
// Or
const merge = (a, b) => [...a, ...b];

// Merge and remove the duplications
const merge = [...new Set(a.concat(b))];
// Or
const merge = [...new Set([...a, ...b])];
```

## 6. Sort an array containing numbers

JavaScript is very tricky when it comes to its built-in sort method. It doesn‚Äôt handle numbers well, so this function is a simple way of sorting your array.

![JavaScript function that sorts an array containing numbers](/assets/one-6.png)

```javascript
// Sort an array containing numbers
const sort = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

sort([1, 5, 2, 4, 3]);
// Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## 7. Generate a random HEX color

Generating an RGB color is a little more simple, but creating a random HEX color can get a little complex. This function will allow you to generate a random HEX color.

![JavaScript function that generates a random HEX color](/assets/one-7.png)

```javascript
// Generate a random HEX color
randomColor = () => `#${Math.random().toString(16).slice(2, 8).padStart(6, '0')}`;

// Or
const randomColor = () => `#${(~~(Math.random()*(1<<24))).toString(16)}`;
```

## 8. Get the value of a specified cookie

Know the name of a cookie and want to read out its specific value?

We can use the ‚Äúcookie‚Äù property of the document object to retrieve it and return it back to us.

![JavaScript function that reads the value of a specific cookie](/assets/one-8.png)

```javascript
// Get the value of a specified cookie
cookie = name => `; ${document.cookie}`.split(`; ${name}=`).pop().split(';').shift();

cookie('_ga');
// Result: "GA1.2.1929736587.1601974046"
```

## 9. Swap the values of 2 variables

Sometimes, you just need to swap 2 variables around. This simple trick will allow you to do that in a single line!

![Using JavaScript, swap the values of 2 variables around](/assets/one-9.png)

```javascript
// Swap the values of 2 variables
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

[a, b] = [b, a];
// Result: 
// a = 2
// b = 1
```

## 10. Get the text that the user has selected

Whenever a user has selected text using the cursor, we can access it using ‚ÄúgetSelection‚Äù method on the window object.

![JavaScript function that gets the text that the user has currently selected](/assets/one-10.png)

```javascript
// Get the text that the user has selected
const getSelectedText = () => window.getSelection().toString();

getSelectedText();
```
