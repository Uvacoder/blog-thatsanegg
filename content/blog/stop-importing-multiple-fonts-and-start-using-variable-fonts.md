***Variable Fonts.***

*Maybe you already know all about them.*

*Maybe you have no clue what they are.*

*In this short article, I‚Äôll take you through how you can use variable fonts to your advantage in creating efficient & fun websites.*

*<hr />*

## Introduction

Variable fonts sure are something cool! They allow you to dynamically change certain properties of a typeface/font.

*Why is this cool?*

Well, normally when using a custom typeface, you will need to import a ton of different fonts.

For example, let‚Äôs say you want to use the typeface ‚ÄúRoboto‚Äù and use a regular font-weight (400), a **bold** one (700), and a **black** one (900).

You will need to import all three of these fonts, which can affect your page‚Äôs performance pretty badly.

Imagine needing even more different typefaces and fonts!

<br />

### This is where variable fonts come into play.

Instead of needing to import multiple fonts for all the different **weights** and *italics* you are using, you need to import just **ONE**.

<br />

## Follow along

So to follow along with this article you can open up your text editor, but I also created a couple of Sandboxes so you can see how it works without having to touch any code yourself.

These are the steps we will be following:

* **Link to the Font**
* **Set the Weights**
* **(extra) Change the Weights**

That‚Äôs all you‚Äôll need üòÑ

<br />

## Link to the Font

So to start, we‚Äôre going to need one of those variable fonts.

There‚Äôs this great resource called *[v-fonts.com](https://v-fonts.com/)* where you can find loads of them.

I found a great font called ‚ÄúRoboto Delta‚Äù hosted *[here](https://googlefonts.github.io/fluid/)*. I‚Äôll be using this from here on.

![Screenshot of the website "v-fonts.com"](../../assets/v-fonts.png "Screenshot of the website \"v-fonts.com\"")

Once we‚Äôve found our variable font, we can start link to it in our CSS file.

First, we use the @font-face rule to import the font.

```css
@font-face {
   font-family: "Roboto Delta";
   src: url("https://googlefonts.github.io/fluid/assets/fonts/RobotoDelta_v2-VF.ttf") format("truetype");
}
```

Then, we define which font weights will be used. For this article, we‚Äôll be using the full range (100‚Äì900).

```css
@font-face {
   font-family: "Roboto Delta";
   src: url("https://googlefonts.github.io/fluid/assets/fonts/RobotoDelta_v2-VF.ttf") format("truetype");
   font-style: normal;
   font-weight: 100 900;
}
```

Great! Now the font is ready to use ü•≥

<br />

## Set the Weights

Now that we‚Äôre ready to use our variable font, let‚Äôs see how.

I‚Äôve created a text-element inside a sandbox to start off.

<iframe
     src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/step-1-variable-font-weight-using-cursor-position-g750q?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
     style="height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="Step 1: Variable Font Weight using Cursor Position"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

The standard font-weight is 400.

We can change this using the*‚Äúfont-variation-settings‚Äù*CSS property*.*

This property takes an axis you want to change (**weight**/width/*italics*/etc.) and the desired value.

For example, we can use set the font-weight to 900 by using:

```css
h1 span {
   font-variation-settings: "wght" 900;
}
```

In the sandbox below, I‚Äôve set one of the texts font-weight to 100, and the other to 900.

<iframe
     src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/step-2-variable-font-weight-using-cursor-position-ks3gu?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
     style="height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="Step 2: Variable Font Weight using Cursor Position"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

Great! The cool thing about this is that we don‚Äôt have to set this font-weight to a perfectly round number.

So instead of using 100/200/300/etc. we can use any number in between.

We‚Äôll be using this in the final/extra step!

<br />

## **(extra) Change the Weights**

Now that we know how to change the properties of a variable font, we can use it to create some awesome effects!

I‚Äôve written a little script that changes the font-weight based on your cursor's position!

It takes in the cursor‚Äôs position on the X-axis, calculates how far it is positioned to the left/right, and sets the font-weight accordingly.

```javascript
const words = document.querySelectorAll("span");

const updateFontWeight = cursorXPosition => {
   const xPercentage = cursorXPosition / window.innerWidth;
   const fontWeight = 800 * xPercentage + 100;
  
   words.forEach((letter, i) => {
      setTimeout(function() {
        letter.style.fontVariationSettings = "'wght' " + fontWeight;
      }, 120 * (i * 0.3));
   });
};

document.body.addEventListener("mousemove", e => {
   updateFontWeight(e.clientX);
});
```

And here we go:

<iframe
     src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/result-variable-font-weight-using-cursor-position-h6u70?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
     style="height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="Result: Variable Font Weight using Cursor Position"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

Here‚Äôs a GIF of the effect if you‚Äôre on mobile:

## Conclusion

Looking back, we‚Äôve used a variable font to create dynamic styling on our webpage. We can do this by importing a variable font in our CSS and then changing its properties using the *‚Äúfont-variation-settings‚Äù* CSS property*.*

Look at how much you‚Äôve learned!
