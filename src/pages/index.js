          These days, web-development can be a very daunting task to learn for
          the developer who's just starting out. With things like JavaScript
          frameworks, server-side rendering, and REST/CRUD API's, it doesn't get
          a lot simpler either.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>However, it doesn't have to be this way!</strong> I love
          writing about making your (developer) life easier. From basic HTML &
          CSS, to more complicated subjects regarding web-development, I write
          about all of them.

          You might know the expression "That's a piece of cake". In Dutch, we
          have a saying that goes likewise. Roughly translated back to English,
          it says <strong>"That's an Egg"</strong>. With my writing, I want to
          make you feel confident in your ability as a developer and think;
          "That's an Egg!".

          <Button>That's an Egg Blog</Button>
